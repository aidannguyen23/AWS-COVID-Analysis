# COVID AWS QuickSight Dashboard

## Project Description
Explore and visualize COVID-19 data insights using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and QuickSight. This repository contains a data analytics dashboard leveraging AWS services to analyze and visualize key trends related to COVID-19.

## Features
- Interactive visualizations showcasing pandemic metrics.
- Utilization of AWS services: RDS, S3, EC2, and QuickSight.
- Data storage, processing, and dashboard creation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- MySQL Workbench
    
### 1. Data Collection:
Choose a public dataset or create a small dataset to work with. For instance, you can use data related to sales, weather, or any domain of your interest.
Set up a MySQL database on AWS RDS (Relational Database Service). Follow the AWS documentation or tutorials to create an instance and load your dataset into MySQL.

### 2. Data Processing:
Use MySQL to perform basic data manipulation and analysis. Practice SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Perform operations like filtering, aggregating, joining tables, etc.

### 3. AWS Services Setup:
Utilize AWS services such as Amazon S3 for storing static files (if needed), AWS Lambda for serverless computing (optional), and Amazon QuickSight for building the dashboard.

### 4. Create a Simple Dashboard:
Use Amazon QuickSight, an AWS data visualization tool, to create a dashboard that displays key metrics or visualizations derived from your MySQL dataset.
Include relevant charts, graphs, and tables to present insights from the data. Aim for clarity and simplicity in the dashboard design.

### 5. Deployment and Documentation:
Host the dashboard on Amazon QuickSight and make it accessible. Document the process, including steps to set up the MySQL database, load data, create queries, and build the dashboard.

## Key Learning Outcomes:
- Demonstrates proficiency in setting up AWS services like RDS, S3, Lambda, and QuickSight.
- Showcases SQL skills through data manipulation and querying in MySQL.
- Highlights your ability to visualize data and derive insights using a dashboard tool like Amazon QuickSight.
